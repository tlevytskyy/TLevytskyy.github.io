									<h1>A Text Based RPG</h1>
									<p>My first dive into doing personal projects.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/SuperAdventure.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Looking back, as my first personal project, this game defines spaghetti code. Its almost embaracing to think that i wrote this only 6 months before today and i almost didnt put it up.
									Looking back though this project was probably what taught me the most about programming to date. It was my first experience working with an interface, Events, and much more.
									One of the most important things i learned is how to work with classes and objects, where as before i only saw them as pretty labels after this projects i got an early introduction
									to object-oriented programming. This being my first big projects it was also my first exposure to the proper use of the debugger and debugging a large (relatively speaking) code base.
								</p>
								<p>The other major learning opportunity this project provided was git. This being a collaboration between 2 people the use of git to merge code and to collaborate between multiple computers became mandatory.
									Although there was still alot more to learn about git after this project was finished, it gave me a good starting point to explore the system some more in the future.
