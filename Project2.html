									<h1>Autonomous Car</h1>
									<p>An experiment in merging hardware and software skills.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/CarGif.gif" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Built using the arduino platform, this car has an array of sensors to help it navigate the real world without the need for any user input. The limitations of imbedded systems
									became apparent early as a severe lack of memory lead to the project being spit into a car side and a server side with bluetooth communication in between them via Serial communication.
									This project is doing all the "thinking" on a laptop running the server application and relaying commands back to the car, while it relays its sensor data in return. The biggest
									takeaway from this project so far is learning how to have multiple different applications talk to each other. Another benefit is that it reinforced my knowledge in other areas
									that I have not had the opportunity to practice this summer. This project has also been a great introduction into using C although a breif one.
								</p>
								<p>The hardware side of things is where alot of knowledge was really gained. This project has for the first time let me apply my electical knowledge, to this point wholy theoretical, and use
									it to build a working machine that does more then just give off heat from some resistors. From learning how basic digital systems such as the arduino work to using sensors to
									understand the world around the car, all of it has been a great help understanding in a more realistic way how electricity works. 
								</p>
								<p>As it stands currently this is an incomeplete project. There are still several modifications that I want to make to the software and hardware side of things
									that will be listed in a ToDo list below. Currently the car can avoid obstacles with no user input and knows what direction its facing
									but that is about all. A wall has been hit in my understanding and requires some serious research before the goal of a robot that understands its
									location in the environment and navigate it autonamously can be reached. Currently my research is heading in the direction of SLAM (Simultanious location and mapping)
									and updates will be made to this page as milestones are hit.
								</p>
								<h2>ToDo</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Have the server ping all open ports on startup and list all available machines</li>
									<li>Rework the movement system to work based on the compass instead of time</li>
									<li>Recreate the autonomous evasion algorithm using the compass for more precise obstacle avoidance</li>
									<li>Update the UI from windows forms to a more modern solution</li>
									<li>Slam Capability</li>
								</ul>
