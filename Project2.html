								<h3>Intro</h3>
								<p>
									During HackEd 2021, a hackathon put on by the UofA, me and 2 friends decided to try to expand a previous remote control car that we made and have it work over the internet.
									This version of the project is a remote control car that is connected view bluetooth to a laptop. A program on the laptop with an AWS server as an intermediary talks to
									a client at my partners house and allows for him to control the car as seen in the video above. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Although this project builds on onother project that was done in the past, everything is rebuilt from scratch and nothing is reused. My role for
									the hackathon was the physical car itself and the laptop client that it is connected to view bluetooth. I got a chance to work on some of my circuit
									building skills and used websockets for the first time. 
								</p>
								<h3>The Car</h3>
								<p>
									For the car, I ended up buying a kick that came with the wheels and body to make construction easier and focus more on the circuitry. Everything other then
									the wheels and body were parts picked and put together by ourselves. The brain of the car is an arduino powered by a 9v battery that drives an H-Bridge chip
									used to control the 4 wheels which are powered by 2 other batteries. The arduino serial ports are connected to a bluetooth module that transmits and receives
									data from the laptop. The car also includes a compass and ultrasound proximity sensor on the front whos data is passed onto the laptop.
								</p>
								<h3>The Laptop</h3>
								<p>
									The laptop runs a simple C# client that will connects to the COM port the bluetooth car is attached to and send commands via serial communication to the 
									car. It also receives sensor data from the car for use in future applications. Using websockets, the laptop connects to an AWS server where it receives 
									commands relayed through the server from a client in another part of the city.
								</p>
								<h3>Future Plans</h3>
								<p>
									As you can probably tell by the title, this project is not yet finished and more work will be done in the future. The next big step is to cut out the 
									bluetooth and middleman client via the use of a ESP8266 wifi chip so that the car can function independantly as long as a wifi connection to the 
									internet is available. A phone app and website to control the car, and a camera installation are also planned as a possible next step.
